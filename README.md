# Django Templates Forest (BETA)

Templates Forest is just a series of django commands that might help you visualise your templates' inheritance and will give you some detailed information about them so you could clean your templates's structure

## Install

1. Add `templates-forest` to your requirements (and install it, via pip or something)
2. Add `templates_forest` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`
3. Add `APPLICATION_DIR` to your settings. This is the path to your app

# How to use

There are currently three django commands and they all have the same common
parameters

## templates_trees
